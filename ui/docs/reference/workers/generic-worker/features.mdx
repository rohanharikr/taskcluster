# Features

Features are capabilities that can be enabled in the generic worker for use by
a task.

These features are enabled by declaring them within the task payload in the
`features` object.

Note: Some features require additional information within the task definition.
Features may also require scopes.  Consult the documentation for each feature
to understand the requirements.

Example:

```js
{
  "payload": {
    "features": {
      "chainOfTrust": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Feature: `chainOfTrust`

#### Since: generic-worker 5.3.0

This feature was added in generic-worker 5.3.0, with gpg support.

#### Since: generic-worker 12.0.0

This feature was updated in generic worker 12.0.0, adding ed25519 support.

#### Since: generic-worker 13.0.0

This feature was updated to remove gpg support.

Enabling this feature will mean that the generic worker will publish three
additional task artifacts: `public/chain-of-trust.json` and
`public/chain-of-trust.json.sig`. These are a text json object, storing the
SHA 256 hashes of the task artifacts, plus some information about the worker.
The `.sig` file is signed by an ed25519 private key, generated and stored on
the worker. This private key is never transmitted across the network. In
the future you will be able to verify the signature of this artifact against
the public keys of the worker type, to be confident that it really was
created by the worker. However currently this is not possible, since we do
not yet publish the public keys anywhere. When this has been implemented,
this page will be updated with details about how to retrieve the public key,
for signature verification.

The worker uses ed25519 private keys from the file locations specified by the
[worker configuration
setting](/reference/workers/generic-worker#set-up-your-env)
`ed25519SigningKeyLocation`.

No scopes are presently required for enabling this feature.

## Feature: `taskclusterProxy`

#### Since: generic-worker 10.6.0

The taskcluster proxy provides an easy and safe way to make authenticated
taskcluster requests within the scope(s) of a particular task.  The proxy
accepts un-authenticated requests and attaches credentials to them
corresponding to `task.scopes` as well as scopes to upload artifacts.

The proxy's rootUrl is available to tasks in the environment variable
`TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL`.  It can be used with a client like this:

```js
var taskcluster = require('taskcluster-client');
var queue = new taskcluster.Queue({
  rootUrl: process.env.TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL,
});
queue.createTask(..);
```

This request would require that `task.scopes` contain the appropriate
`queue:create-task:..` scope for the `createTask` API call.

*NOTE*: as a special case, the scopes required to call
`queue.createArtifact(<taskId>, <runId>, ..)` are automatically included,
regardless of `task.scopes`.

The proxy is easy to use within a shell command, too:

```sh
curl $TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL/api/secrets/v1/secret/my-top-secret-secret
# ..or
cat secret | curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --request PUT --data @- $TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL/api/secrets/v1/secret/my-top-secret-secret
```

These invocations would require `secrets:get:my-top-secret-secret` or `secrets:put:my-top-secret-secret`, respectively, in `task.scopes`.
