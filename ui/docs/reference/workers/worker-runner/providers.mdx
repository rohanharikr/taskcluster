# Providers

<!-- PROVIDERS BEGIN -->
Providers are configured in the `provider` portion of the runner configuration.  The `providerType` property
determines which provider is in use.  The allowed values are:

## aws

The providerType "aws" is intended for workers provisioned with worker-manager
providers using providerType "aws".  It requires

```yaml
provider:
    providerType: aws
```

The [$TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/design/env-vars#taskcluster_worker_location)
defined by this provider has the following fields:

* cloud: aws
* region
* availabilityZone

## azure

The providerType "azure" is intended for workers provisioned with worker-manager
providers using providerType "azure".  It requires

```yaml
provider:
    providerType: azure
```

The [$TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/design/env-vars#taskcluster_worker_location)
defined by this provider has the following fields:

* cloud: azure
* region

## google

The providerType "google" is intended for workers provisioned with worker-manager
providers using providerType "google".  It requires

```yaml
provider:
    providerType: google
```

The [$TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/design/env-vars#taskcluster_worker_location)
defined by this provider has the following fields:

* cloud: google
* region
* zone

## standalone

The providerType "standalone" is intended for workers that have all of their
configuration pre-loaded.  Such workers do not interact with the worker manager.
This is not a recommended configuration - prefer to use the static provider.

It requires the following properties be included explicitly in the runner
configuration:

```yaml
provider:
    providerType: standalone
    rootURL: ..  # note the Golang spelling with capitalized "URL"
    clientID: .. # ..and similarly capitalized ID
    accessToken: ..
    workerPoolID: ..
    workerGroup: ..
    workerID: ..
	# (optional) custom provider-metadata entries to be passed to worker
	providerMetadata: {prop: val, ..}
    # (optional) custom properties for TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION
	# (values must be strings)
    workerLocation:  {prop: val, ..}
```

The [$TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/design/env-vars#taskcluster_worker_location)
defined by this provider has the following fields:

* cloud: standalone

as well as any worker location values from the configuration.

## static

The providerType "static" is intended for workers provisioned with worker-manager
providers using providerType "static".  It requires

```yaml
provider:
    providerType: static
    rootURL: ..    # note the Golang spelling with capitalized "URL"
    providerID: .. # ..and similarly capitalized ID
    workerPoolID: ...
    workerGroup: ...
    workerID: ...
    staticSecret: ... # shared secret configured for this worker in worker-manager
	# (optional) custom provider-metadata entries to be passed to worker
	providerMetadata: {prop: val, ..}
    # (optional) custom properties for TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION
	# (values must be strings)
    workerLocation:  {prop: val, ..}
```

The [$TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/design/env-vars#taskcluster_worker_location)
defined by this provider has the following fields:

* cloud: static

as well as any worker location values from the configuration.
