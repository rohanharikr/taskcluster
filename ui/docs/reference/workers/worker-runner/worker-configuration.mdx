# Worker Configuration

Worker configuration comes from a number of sources; in order from lowest to
highest precedence, these are:

* The worker runner config file
* The configuration defined by the provider, if any
* Configuration stored in the secrets service

Providers can supply configuration to the worker via whatever means makes sense.
For example, an EC2 or GCP provider would read configuration from the instance's userData.

## Configuration from Runner Config

The runner configuration file is described in more detail in the "Usage" section below.
Its `workerConfig` property can contain arbitrary worker configuration values.
For example:

```yaml
provider: ..
worker: ..
workerConfig:
  shutdownMachineOnIdle:  true
```

Note that the deeply-nested format described in the next section is not available in the runner config file.

## Configuration from the Provider

Providers that interact with the worker-manager service can get configuration from that service.
That configuration formally has the form:

```yaml
<workerImplementation>:
  config:
    workerConfigValue: ...
  files:
    - ...
```

Where all fields are optional.
The `<workerImplementation>` is replaced with the worker implementation name, in camel case (`genericWorker`, `dockerWorker`, etc.)
The contents of `<workerImplementation>.config` are merged into the worker configuration.
Files are handled as described below.

For backward compatibility, configuration may be specified as a simple object with configuration properties at the top level.
Support for this form will be removed in future versions.

Putting all of this together, a worker pool definition for a generic-worker instance might contain:
```yaml
launchConfigs:
- ...
  workerConfig:
    genericWorker:
      config:
        shutdownMachineOnInternalError: true
```

## Secrets

Secrets are stored in the secrets service under a secret named
`worker-pool:<workerPoolId>`, in the format

```yaml
config:
  workerConfigValue: ...
files:
  - ...
```

Where `config` is an object that is merged directly into the worker config.

Two backward-compatibility measures exist:

1. A secret named `worker-type:<workerPoolId>` is also consulted, as used before [RFC#145](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0145-workerpoolid-taskqueueid.md) landed.
1. If a secret does not have properties `config` and `files`, then its top-level contents are assumed to be worker configuration, with no files.

## Files

Files can also be stored in the secrets service and in provider configuration, under the `files` properties described above.
These can be used to write (small) files to disk on the worker before it starts up.
For example:

```yaml
files:
  - content: U....x8j==
    description: Secret Data!
    encoding: base64
    format: zip
    path: 'C:\secrets'
```

This would unzip the zipfile represented by `content` at `C:\secrets`.

The only encoding supported is `base64`.
The formats supported are:

 * `file` -- the content is decoded and written to the file named by `path`
 * `zip` -- the content is treated as a ZIP archive and extracted at the directory named by `path`
