# worker-runner

Worker runner is a tool for running workers.
Workers can be deployed in lots of ways: various clouds or as hardware, in various deployments of Taskcluster, and with various worker implementations.
Worker Runner exists as a common implementation supporting all of those configurations.

The tool handles, among other things:

 - Getting Taskcluster credentials
 - Interacting with the [worker manager](/docs/reference/core/worker-manager/worker-interaction)
 - Gathering configuration from various sources
 - Polling for interruptions of cloud instances (e.g., spot termination)

## Theory of Operation

Worker-runner interfaces between a cloud "provider", the worker-runner service, and a worker.
The term "provider" is defined loosely to include non-cloud worker deployments.

In operation, this tool performs the following steps to determine the
parameters for a run of a worker:

 * Read the *runner* configuration (`<runnerConfig>`).
 * Load the given provider and ask it to add settings to the run.  This
   step provides
   * Taskcluster credentials for the worker,
   * worker identification information (worker pool, worker ID, etc.),
   * the location of the worker, and
   * worker configuration.
 * Using the Taskcluster credentials, load configuration from the secrets
   service.
 * Load support for the given worker implementation and ask it to add
   settings to the run.

With all of this complete, the run parameters are fully determined:

 * Taskcluster contact information (rootURL, credentials)
 * Worker identity
 * Metadata from the provider (useful for user debugging)
 * Configuration for the worker (see below for details)

The final step, then, is to start the worker with the derived configuration.
The worker is run as a subprocess, with a simple, text-based protocol between start-worker and the worker itself.
The protocol is defined in [../../internal/workerproto](internal/workerproto).
This protocol is used to communicate events such as an impending shutdown.

## Usage

The tool is compiled to a binary named `start-worker`.
Builds for several architectures are attached to each [Taskcluster release](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/).

The binary should be installed on workers and configured to run at instance start up, taking a "runner configuration" filename as its argument.

```
start-worker <runnerConfig>
```
