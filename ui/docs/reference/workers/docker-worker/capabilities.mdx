# Capabilities

Capabilities are similar to features, but control access to components of the host machine.

## Devices

Docker-worker permits controlled access to host devices.
To enable a device for a task, the task definition must have

```yaml
payload:
  capabilities:
    devices:
      <deviceName>: true
```

It must also have scope `docker-worker:capability:device:<deviceName>` or scope `docker-worker:capability:device:<deviceName>:<workerPoolId>`.

The worker configuration controls whether a device is available, although most default to available (details below).
```yaml
deviceManagement:
  <deviceName>: true  # or false to disable
```

The supported devices follow.

### loopbackVideo

This device allocates one of `/dev/videoN` for some N to the task and mounts that device into the container.
Concurrent tasks will be allocated different devices, although note that the device name will vary within the containers.

This device requires the `v4l2loopback` driver be installed in the kernel.

### loopbackAudio

This device is similar to `loopbackVideo`, but allocates

* `/dev/snd/controlC<deviceId>`
* `/dev/snd/pcmC<deviceId>D0c`
* `/dev/snd/pcmC<deviceId>D0p`
* `/dev/snd/pcmC<deviceId>D1c`
* `/dev/snd/pcmC<deviceId>D1p`

This device requires the `snd-aloop` driver be installed in the kernel and configured.

### hostSharedMemory

This device mounts `/dev/shm` within the container.

### kvm

This device mounts `/dev/kvm` within the container.

### cpu

This "device" is different from the others.
If `restrictCPU` is set to true in the worker configuration, then each task will be restricted to a single CPU on the host using Docker's `CpusetCpus` support.
No task configuration or scopes are required.

## Privileged

This capability enables "privileged" mode on the docker container.
While the [Docker documentation](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/) treats the topic lightly, this is very similar to giving the container "root" access to the host machine, and should not be undertaken lightly.
Among other things, malicious code running in a task with this capability could get access to the worker's credentials.

Access to this capability is controlled both in the worker config and by scopes.

The worker config must contain

```yaml
dockerConfig:
  allowPrivileged: true
```

to support privileged tasks.

A task wishing to operate in a privileged container must have

```yaml
payload:
  capabilities:
    privileged: true
```

It must also have scope `docker-worker:capability:privileged` or scope `docker-worker:capability:privileged:<workerPoolId>`.
The second form is preferred, as it is specific to a single worker pool.
