# Caches

Docker-worker has the ability to provide volumes mounted within the task container that can persist between tasks. This provides a way of caching large often used files (repos, object directories) and share them between tasks.

Volume caches falls under the garbage collection policies when diskspace threshold is reached. Any cached volumes that are no longer mounted within a container are removed from the host system when this event occurs.

Tasks need to define a name for the cache that will be used for other tasks requiring the same cached volume as well as a mount point for where the volume will be mounted within the task container.

Use of a cache requires either of the following scopes:

 - `docker-worker:cache:<cache name>`
 - `docker-worker:cache:<cache name>:<workerPoolId>`

Note that the second form does not allow use of a `*` for the cache name, while still fixing the worker pool.
For example, there is no way to represent "all caches with the prefix `objdir-` on worker pool `build/linux`".

Example:

```js
{
  "scopes": [
    "docker-worker:cache:abc-object-directory"
  ],
  "payload": {
    "cache": {
      "b2g-object-directory": "/path/for/mount/point"
    }
  }
}
```
